The data acquisition, the analysis and the hypotheses can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file *prj01.ipynb*.

Before executing the notebook, the files inside the following Zip Files have to be extracted into the same directory:
1. Bestand_SC_Alter_Berufswunsch_RGS.zip
2. clean_data.zip
3. merged_data.zip

This is because the files are too large for GitHub.
