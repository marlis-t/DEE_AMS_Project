The data acquisition, the analysis and the hypotheses can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file *Arbeitsmarkt_DEE_Project.ipynb*.

Before executing the notebook, the following Files have to be in the same directory:
1. Bestand_SC_Alter_Berufswunsch_RGS.csv
2. clean_data.csv
3. merged_data.csv
4. 24-598_AMS-Berufssystematik_Stand_05-2024.xlsx
5. laender_95_geo.json

This is because their contents are read during the notebook's runtime.


The additional data used is
- 001_amd-online_verzeichnis_arbeitsmarktbezirke.pdf to match RGSCodes to their counties
- 24-598_AMS-Berufssystematik_Stand_05-2024.xlsx to group jobs into job groups to facilitate analysis

The links for those files can be found in the notebook.

All additionally used sources are also linked at their relevant places in the notebook.
